## React Reveal

[React Reveal by CanadaInnovates](https://github.com/CanadaInnovates/react-reveal) is an extension of [React Reveal](https://www.react-reveal.com/),
an animation framework for React. Along with the various
cool reveal on scroll animations, we're aimed at migrating react-reveal
to expose hooks API for the latest cool features of React in Functional components.

## Live Examples

A number of simple effect examples:
- [Fade](https://www.react-reveal.com/examples/common/fade/)
- [Flip](https://www.react-reveal.com/examples/common/flip/)
- [Rotate](https://www.react-reveal.com/examples/common/rotate/)
- [Zoom](https://www.react-reveal.com/examples/common/zoom/)
- [Bounce](https://www.react-reveal.com/examples/common/bounce/)
- [Roll](https://www.react-reveal.com/examples/common/roll/)

Also, there are more complicated examples of [animated form errors](https://www.react-reveal.com/examples/advanced/form/) and a [todo app](https://www.react-reveal.com/examples/advanced/todo/).

## Installation

In the command prompt run:

```sh
npm install @canadainnovates/react-reveal --save
```

Alternatively you may use `yarn`:

```sh
yarn add @canadainnovates/react-reveal
```

## Quick Start

Import effects from [React Reveal](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@canadainnovates/react-reveal) to your project. Lets try `Zoom` effect first:

```javascript
import Zoom from '@canadainnovates/react-reveal/Zoom';
```

Place the following code somewhere in your `render` method: 

```jsx
<Zoom>
  <p>Markup that will be revealed on scroll</p>
</Zoom>
```

You should see zooming animation that reveals text inside the tag. You can change this text to any JSX you want. If you place this code further down the page you'll see that it'd appear as you scroll down.

## Revealing React Components

You may just wrap your custom React component with the effect of your choosing like so:

```jsx
<Zoom>  
  <CustomComponent />
</Zoom>
```

In such case, in the resulting `<CustomComponent />` HTML markup will be wrapped in a `div` tag. If you would rather have a different HTML tag then wrap `<CustomComponent />` in a tag of your choosing:

```jsx
<Zoom>
  <section>
    <CustomComponent />   
  </section>
</Zoom>
```

or if you want to customize `div` props:

```jsx
<Zoom>
  <div className="some-class">
    <CustomComponent />   
  </div>
</Zoom>
```

## Revealing Images

If you want to reveal an image you can wrap `img` tag with with the desired `@canadainnovates/react-reveal` effect:

```jsx
<Zoom>
  <img height="300" width="400" src="https://source.unsplash.com/random/300x400" />
</Zoom>
```

It would be a very good idea to specify width and height of any image you wish to reveal.

## Children

`@canadainnovates/react-reveal` will attach a reveal effect to each child it gets. In other words,

```jsx
<Zoom>
  <div>First Child</div>
  <div>Second Child</div>
</Zoom>
```

will be equivalent to:

```jsx
<Zoom>
  <div>First Child</div>
</Zoom>
<Zoom>
  <div>Second Child</div>
</Zoom>  
```

If you don't want this to happen, you should wrap multiple children in a `div` tag:

```jsx
<Zoom>
  <div>
    <div>First Child</div>
    <div>Second Child</div>
  </div>
</Zoom>
```


## Server Side Rendering

`@canadainnovates/react-reveal` supports server side rendering out of the box. In some cases, when the javascript bundle arrives much later than the HTML&CSS it might cause a flickering. To prevent this `@canadainnovates/react-reveal` will not apply reveal effects on the initial load. 
Another option is to apply gentle fadeout effect on the initial render. You can force it on all `@canadainnovates/react-reveal` elements by placing the following code somewhere near the entry point of your app:

```jsx
import config from '@canadainnovates/react-reveal/globals';

config({ ssrFadeout: true });
```

Or you you can do it on a per element basis using `ssrFadeout` prop:

```jsx
<Zoom ssrFadeout><h1>Content</h1></Zoom>
```

One last option is to use `ssrReveal` prop. If enabled, this option will suppress both flickering and `ssrFadeout` effect. The unfortunate drawback of this option is that the revealed content will appear hidden to Googlebot and to anyone with javascript switched off. So it will makes sense for images and/or headings which are duplicated elsewhere on the page.

## Ref Injection with withReveal

withReveal will wrap your component in a div tag for it to work. If you don't want that then you can pass `forwardRef` prop to the component created with withReveal.Consider following custom React Component:

```jsx
const StyledDiv = styled.li`
  color: palevioletred;
  font-weight: bold;
`;

function OldComponent({ innerRef, className, style }) {
const { innerRef, children, style, ...rest } = props;
  return (<StyledDiv ref={innerRef} style={style} {...rest}>{children}</StyledDiv>);
  }
```
And then you can inject reveal functionality using following code:
```jsx
const NewComponent = withReveal(OldComponent, <Fade left />);
```
And then you can pass `forwardRef` prop to the NewComponent where you use it in the code like this:
```jsx
<NewComponent forwardRef>Some content of 1</NewComponent>
```
## Up-coming Features
In the pipeline, we are going the add functional hooks for all available
reveal effects. Here is a list of hooks for simple effects:

Fade -> useFade
Flip -> useFlip
Rotate -> Rotate
Zoom -> useZoom
Bounce -> useBounce
Roll -> useRoll
